Hey readers! This is [Kasper](https://twitter.com/kaspth) bringing you the latest news in Rails. I'm writing from deep winter-like Copenhagen, starting on the last month of the decade.  
  
Speaking of progress, Rails recently crossed 75.000 commits on GitHub. Last time we marked commit progress was over 4 years ago for 50.000. I happened to write that issue too, you can&nbsp;[read it here](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2015/3/7/this-week-in-rails-50-000-commits-gsoc-opportunity-and-more/).

Also&nbsp;[41 people contributed](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/in-time-window/20191116-20191201) since last time including several first time contributors.  
  
Hope you dig it. See ya next time! 👋🏻
